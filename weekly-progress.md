# Weekly Progress

## Week of February 17



## Week of February 10

We have spent this week refining our idea in response to Professor Stolley’s feedback.

We have decided to not focus on accommodations during the alpha development cycle in an effort to scope-hammer our system. Instead, this phase will focus on building the core feature which is the transportation information of the user’s travel. An update to our pitch: we will allow users to have multiple instances of transportation per trip. As mentioned in our pitch documentation, we have already found an API where we will pull in flight data from and users will be able to input other modes of transport that they will be using themselves.

We are also looking into the implementation of user logins into our web application and how this would relate to the database structure.

We have made a few decisions regarding the components of our architecture. We decided we will be using NodeJS as our server-side scripting language with Express as our framework. In regards to our database, we will utilize MongoDB. And just to reiterate, our front-end languages will be in HTML, CSS, and JS.

We have created a new repository strictly for the alpha cycle called alpha-jellyfish (link to repo here: https://github.com/jellyfish-wsi/alpha-jellyfish). The previous GitHub repository (jellyfish-p2) only contains our project pitch and will also be used to store our weekly progress reports.

Currently, we are deciding on the architecture pattern of our web application. The patterns we are currently considering are: layers pattern, shared-data pattern, and multi-tier pattern. Our goal is to decide by Friday which of these will suit our project best during our meeting.

On a different note, we are also currently brainstorming ideas on what to call our web application.
